//In Sass, a mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site.
//Mixins also have the ability to take in a value.
//An argument, or parameter, is a value passed to the mixin that will be used inside the mixin
//Try to only create mixins that take in an argument, otherwise you should extend.
//Always look at your CSS output to make sure your extend is behaving as you intended.
@mixin each-blockquote($file){
 &:after{
  @extend %eachblockquote;
  background-image: url(#{$file}.jpg);
